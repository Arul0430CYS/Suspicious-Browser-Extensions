   - **Firefox:** Go to about:addons  

2. Review all installed extensions carefully.  
   - Look for names or icons you don’t recognize.  
   - Note down all extensions currently installed.  

3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension.  
   - In Chrome, click “Details” to view permissions.  
   - Search the extension name online for user feedback or warnings.  

4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions.  
   - Suspicious signs: unknown publisher, excessive permissions, poor reviews.  

5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions.  
   - Click **Remove** or **Trash icon** beside the extension name.  

6. Restart your browser and check for performance improvements.  
   - Observe faster loading or fewer ads/pop-ups.  

7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users.  
   - Example risks: data theft, ad injection, redirection to phishing sites.  

8. Document the steps taken and list of extensions removed.  
   - Example:  
     - Removed: “Free VPN Unlimited” (unknown publisher, suspicious permissions)  
     - Removed: “FastSearch Pro” (redirects search results)  
     - No issues found with remaining extensions.
